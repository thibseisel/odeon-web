/* Build a Material theme */

/*  Typography */
// To change your theme's typography, we recommend importing a font from Google Fonts and setting the global font-family https://fonts.google.com
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500');
$mdc-typography-font-family: unquote("Roboto, sans-serif");

/* Shape */
// The shapes of small, medium, and large components can be themed by overriding the default values. 
// We recommend using our shape customization tool to help you pick your radius values. https://material.io/design/shape/about-shape.html#shape-customization-tool
$mdc-shape-small-component-radius: 8px;
$mdc-shape-medium-component-radius: 8px;
$mdc-shape-large-component-radius: 4px;

/* Color */
// To change your theme's color scheme, replace the existing HEX color values with custom HEX color values. 
// Use our color palette generator to help come up with pairings and check your color contrast. https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors

// Primary colors map to components such as app bars and buttons, 
// while secondary colors are used as accents on components such as FABs and selection controls.
$mdc-theme-primary: #BB86FC;
$mdc-theme-secondary: #FFD180;

// Theme background appears behind scrollable content. 
// Surface color is mapped to the surface of components such as cards, sheets, and menus. 
// Error color is used to indicate an error state for components such as text fields provided with inaccurate input.
$mdc-theme-surface: #121212;
$mdc-theme-background: #121212;
$mdc-theme-error: #CF6679;

// “On-” colors define how text, icons, and strokes are colored in relation to the surface on which they appear. 
// If you are updating these manually, be sure to consider accessible color contrast for the value pairs.
